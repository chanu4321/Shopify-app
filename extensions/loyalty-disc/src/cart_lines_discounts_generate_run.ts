 * Billfree Loyalty Discount Function

 * Since Shopify Functions cannot make HTTP requests, this function
 * validates discount codes that are generated by the Billfree system
 * when customers redeem loyalty points through other channels.
 * 
 * The customer journey is:
 * 1. Customer redeems loyalty points via Customer Account UI extension
 * 2. After OTP verification, backend creates a Shopify discount code
 * 3. Customer manually enters the discount code at checkout
 * 4. This function validates the discount code is from Billfree
